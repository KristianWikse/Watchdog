# The watchdog project

##__About__##
As our bachelor project we chose to make a smart surveillance system that was capable of distinguishing beetween animals, vehicles and animals. This was suppsoed to be accessed by users through an app, be powered by a battery and charged by a solar panel. The device also had to be capable of communicating with the app using a celluar connection to be accessible in remote locations. This repository contains the files the device used to run like we explained above.
